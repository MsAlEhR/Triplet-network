# Triplet: DNA Language Models  Notebook

 This repository contains an interactive notebook that explores the world of DNA sequence analysis using language models. In this notebook, we'll dive into pre-training and fine-tuning techniques for large language models customized for DNA data.

## Overview

In this notebook, you will discover:

- **Pre-training** with Hugging Face methodologies tailored for DNA sequences.
- Generating informative **DNA sequence embeddings** using pre-trained models.
- **Fine-tuning** pre-trained embeddings for taxonomic classification and other applications.
- Enhancing your model with **contrastive learning** and a **triplet architecture**.
- Visualizing and comparing the effectiveness of different embeddings.
